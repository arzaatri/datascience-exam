    "\n",
    "Consider a regression setting where $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^p$ and $Y \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The goal is to come up with a function $f(X): \\mathbb{R}^p \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ that minimizes the squared-error loss $(Y - f(X))^2$. Since X, Y are random variables, we seek to minimize the expectation of the squared error loss as follows\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",

For example, linear regression explicitly assumes that the regression function is approximately linear in its arguments, i.e. $\\hat{f}(x) = x^T\\beta$ while a neural network provides a nonlinear approximation of the regression function. \n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest of all these methods is [k-nearest neighbors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm). Given $x$ and some neighbourhood of $k$ points $N_k(x)$, $\\hat{f}(x)$ is simply the average of all $y_i|x_i \\in N_k(x)$.  Let $N$ denote the training sample size. Under mild regularity conditions on the joint probability distribution $Pr(X, Y)$, one can show that as $N \\rightarrow \\infty$, $k \\rightarrow \\infty$ such that $k/N \\rightarrow 0$, then $\\hat{f}(x) \\rightarrow f(x)$ where $\\rightarrow$ means approaches or goes to. In other words, the k-nearest neighbors algorithm converges to the ideal solution as both the training sample size and number of neighbors increase to infinity.\n",

    "We can use entropy to find an initial subset of features. (Skip to next paragraph if you don't need the math of entropy, conditional entropy, and information gain.) Given a label Y, we compute the entropy of Y as $H(Y) = -\\sum_{i=1}^np_ilogp_i$. This metric of  tells us about how strongly we are able to make statements about a variable's expected outcome; it maxes out at 1 when all labels are equally present, and moves towards 0 as proportions become more imblanaced. We can then define conditional entropy. Givena feature X, we define $H(Y|X) = \\sum_{x\\in X, y\\in Y} p(x,y)log\\frac{p(x,y)}{p(x)}$. This describes how much more information we need to be certain about the outcome of $Y$ given that $X=x$. Using this, we compute information gain as $H(Y) - H(Y|X)$, which intuitively tells us how much knowing the value of $X$ allows us to narrow down the possible outcomes of $Y$ - that is, how much better we can now predict the label.\n",
    "\n",
    "We compute the information gain of each feature and the best k. Depending on how we want to proceed, k can be several different values. First, we should do an 80-20 train-test split, being a bit more generous than usual with the test size to get a better generalization measure. If we want strong interpretability of our model, we follow the heuristic of a 10:1 data:features ratio and so choose the top 8 features to fit our 80 samples. If we don't mind a difficult to interpret model, we can choose a greater number of features, standardize our data, and use PCA to take the top components. We should only do this if we can preserve a suitable amount of information (let's say 95\\%, though there are many more robust rules) in $\\leq$ 8  principal components, following the same heuristic from before.\n",
    "\n",
    "In either case, we then choose and evaluate a baseline, and choose which algorithms we plant to try. Our N is small, so we should stick to simpler algorithms. Logistic regression is known to be relatively robust against small sample sizes; Naive Bayes would likely work here too, though it would need smoothing. A decision tree could work as well so long as we limit the depth and split conditions, and perhaps an even more restricted Random Forest could do well. Because we can, let's also try kNN and an SVM. We *could* try gradient boost, but I would expect that to overfit. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we carry out hyperparameter tuning for each algorithm via 5-fold cross-validation, using a hyperparameter selection method of our choice (I use HyperOpt). We ensure that the search covers hyperparameters , e.g. allowing high regularization strengths to be chosen, limiting n_estimators in XGBoost, etc. and select the parameter set that achieves the lowest validation loss.  Finally, we evaluate each model on the test set to estimate its generalization performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The univariate selection we carried out is easy, but it has its detriments. In particular, collinearity is an issue. If two features measure the same value and both have high information gain, we end up including redundant information in our subset. An alternative would be to use information gain to find the top 100 or so features, then find the best subset of 8 or so features, either through a direct best subset method or by something less computationally expensive, like stepwise selection."
